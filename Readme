Tcalc is a simple but flexible text based ledger/spreadsheet calculator.

It allows you to create your own custom forms, ledgers, and spreadsheets as
plain text files and to be able to do all your accounting using the full power
of your favorite text editor.

To install just type "make install".
Then type "man tcalc" to read the manual.

Requirements:
    
 * Perl 5 or greater.
 * grutatxt  (optional)

   grutatxt is only required to make the manual, tcalc.1, from the source
   file, tcalc.man.  It comes pre-built, so grutatxt is only needed if you
   modify the manual and need to re-generate it.
